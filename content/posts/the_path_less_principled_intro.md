description: "Introducing The Path Less Principled, a new series exploring common pitfalls in engineering and architecture when decisions are made without guiding principles, careful trade-offs, or operational foresight."
summary: "A series examining real-world patterns and examples of unprincipled engineering: the hidden costs of adopting standards blindly, overlooked trade-offs, and the operational pitfalls that can turn ambitious projects into fragile systems."

[^1]: The above quote is excerpted from the poem: *The Road Not Taken* (https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken)

Robert Frost’s famous lines have long been shorthand for making thoughtful, independent choices. Similarly, in engineering, we aspire to make thoughtful, independent choices grounded in first principles. However, there is also a path defined by the opposite: the path less principled. It’s where decisions are driven by convenience, hype, or imitation, rather than by first principles, deliberate trade-offs, and long-term consequences.

This series will explore those common pitfalls — the moments where teams and engineers stray from disciplined, principled decision-making. Each post will highlight real-world patterns I’ve seen in architecture, platform design, and systems engineering: when adopting a standard doesn’t make sense, when the cost of a new program is underestimated, or when operational realities are ignored.
The goal isn’t to prescribe rigid rules, but to illuminate the consequences of unprincipled choices and provide a lens for thinking more deliberately about trade-offs. Consider this a series for navigating the subtle traps that can turn ambitious projects into fragile, hard-to-maintain, costly systems that users dislike using.

Welcome to _The Path Less Principled_. Let’s explore where this series of blog posts leads — and, more importantly, what we can learn before taking the wrong turn.
