# Introduction
I’m a *Principal* Architect by trade, and _try_ to be a *principled* one by instinct.

That's where the name of this site comes from: principaled.dev - a wordplay on principal and principled (and it so happens to end with "ed" for education, fitting for a blog that hopes to share lessons learned).

*Fun fact*: early in my career, I thought the level associated to an engineering role was called “Principled Engineer.” I’d only ever heard coworkers say it, never seen it written out. I assumed a principal engineer had to be principled to reach that level. The spelling lesson stuck, but the idea stuck even more.

I’ve spent enough time close to large production systems to develop a deep respect for boring reliability, sharp edges, and the long tail of technical decisions. At the same time, I remain curious and deliberate in trying new approaches, always testing ideas against principles, trade-offs, and long-term impact.

Early in my career, I worked as a full-stack developer with a stronger focus in front-end development and UX, which gave me grounding in user-facing concerns. At the same time, I discovered a passion for back-end development, distributed systems, networking, and infrastructure. Since then, I pivoted my career to focus on just that: building successful large-scale platforms and distributed systems where software design, operations, and organizational constraints collide. This breadth has taught me that principled decision-making, empathy for both users and operators, and attention to long-term consequences matter far more than any single technology or framework.

I care little about frameworks and even less about buzzwords or hype. I care most about fundamentals - thinking from first principles: clear interfaces and ownership, explicit understanding of trade-offs, operational empathy, and systems that behave predictably under load and failure scenarios. To me, that is the heart of engineering.

My current work, and much of the past decade, has lived at the intersection of:
- Platform engineering and DevOps
- Developer experience and service frameworks
- Kubernetes and cloud-native systems
- On-premise and cloud infrastructure
- Golang, Rust, and systems-oriented programming
- Making architectural decisions at scale
- Building sustainable, foundational systems that outlast hype cycles

Beyond the technical, I focus on strategic planning: publishing engineering principles and philosophies, helping teams adopt them, and developing and shaping long-term product strategy in alignment with those principles.

As a result, it's likely that the posts here will often explore ideas related to these technical and strategic intersections.

# Intention
This blog exists primarily as a thinking space.

I write to:
- explore ideas that genuinely intrigue me
- clarify my own understanding through writing
- challenge assumptions I may hold
- document lessons learned, often the hard way

It is not meant to be:
- a résumé or personal brand exercise
- a portfolio of achievements
- a collection of authoritative “best practices”

Posts here reflect my perspective at a point in time, informed by experience but not presented as universal truth. Expect opinions, trade-offs, and occasional uncertainty.

You can expect writing about architecture lessons, software design, systems thinking, and principled engineering—the trade-offs that matter at scale. I’ll also cover the work itself: the role, the career, and the tensions and decisions that come with it… and sometimes whatever else happens to be top of mind.

# On Anonymity
You may notice my name is absent. That is intentional. This space is about ideas, not identity.

This blog isn’t about building a personal brand. Anonymity allows me to write candidly, revise my thinking, and focus on substance over attribution.

If something here is useful, disagreeable, or thought-provoking, that’s enough. The ideas should stand on their own.

I may change my mind in the future and attach my name to this blog. If that happens, I’ll update this.

# Disclaimer
I am employed. The views and opinions expressed here are entirely my own and do not represent those of my employer, past or present.

Nothing on this site should be interpreted as official guidance, policy, or endorsement, but rather just a random individual with a laptop and a lot of thoughts, thinking out loud.

Choosing not to attach my name to this blog is not about avoiding my employer’s attention. It’s about keeping the focus on the ideas themselves, not the person behind them.

Ultimately, the content here does not include proprietary or confidential information and is written with respect for professional obligations.
